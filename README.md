# odl (Oracle Download Utility)

Automating tests can be a pain, I'm hoping this utility will provide developers with a quick and easy way to fetch Oracle media files.

The goal isn't to bypass the OTN license agreement, or not to log in - the download will not work if you do not provide valid OTN authentication credentials. There are two mechanisms for the username. Pass in the flag: -username <username> to the program; set an environment variable, `OTN_USERNAME`. The password has three mechanisms. Pass in the flag -password; set an environment variable, `OTN_PASSWORD`; Enter the password at run time, when prompted.

Sample usage:

```bash
trent@birroth:/tmp/xe$ export OTN_USERNAME="joe.bloggs@gmail.com"
trent@birroth:/tmp/xe$ odl -getFile db11gxe-linux
joe.bloggs@gmail.com
Do you accept the XE license agreenement?

Enter Y for Yes, or N for No: Y
Enter your OTN password (trent.schafer@gmail.com):

```

Keep in mind, at this stage it is a very early prototype. It needs to be fleshed out a lot more. The next tasks on the pipeline are to modularise the program more, print the license agreement to the screen and then to include other installation media, with the next priority media files being APEX and SQLcl.
